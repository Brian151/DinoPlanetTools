[prerequisites]
1. TEX<0,1>.bin/.tab/.manifest.json
    the TEX bins/tabs may be extracted from the ROM via
        1a. DinoFST (https://github.com/HugoPeters/dinofst)
        1b. the decompilation tools (https://github.com/zestydevy/dinosaur-planet)
        1c. the #dp-general channel on the Dinosaur Planet Fan Community Discord server
          the message was pinned by a staff member
    the manifest.json is a custom format for this tool and the current one
      always can be found in the data directory of this tool
2. for the time being, files found within the ROM will not be included


[starting]
1. 
load the desired TEX.bin 
    load the matching TEX<x>.bin, TEX<x>, TEX<x>.manifest.json files
      into the corresponding file inputs
2. 
click the "LOAD!" button

[navigating]
1. click any of the buttons to the left to view a texture and its details
2. previous/next will open the previous/next textures, respectively



[editing texture details]
1. name : this is a human-friendly name for the texture
2. tags : comma-seaparated tags to make searching/organizing easier*
3. path : the full file path to export/import to/from**
4. update entry : the current contents of the aforementioned text boxes will 
  be written to the manifest entry for this texture

5. previous/next by default will update this texture's entry before cycling
  there is currently no way to disable this behavior

[importing/exporting]
1. export manifest data will export the current manifest to a json file
2. by nature, loading a manifest file is to import it
3. **textures cannot at this time be imported/exported

[tips and troubleshooting]
1. create a separarate folder for your bins/tabs/manifests
2. the tool may need to be re-loaded the first time it's launched
